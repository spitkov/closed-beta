**Lumin** is a Discord bot built to replace and improve upon its predecessor, *FightMan01 bot*. It's a versatile bot featuring moderation, utility, and fun commands.

## Running the Bot

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.12+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- Recommended OS: **Linux** or **macOS** (for optimal compatibility with `uvloop`)

> `uvloop` is installed automatically on Linux/macOS via `pyproject.toml` dependency markers.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/project-lumin/closed-beta.git
   cd lumin
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

    - This installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
    - `uvloop` will be included automatically on supported platforms

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with the following keys:
   ```
   TOKEN=your-bot-token
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

4. **Install PostgreSQL**, then:
    - Create a user named `lumin` with the password you defined above
    - Create a database named `lumin`, preferably owned by the `lumin` user
    - Optionally initialize tables by running the contents of `first_time.sql`

5. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Contributor Notice

1. We use **ClickUp** for internal task management (external contributors won’t have access).
    - You're welcome to contribute via PRs — we’ll review and respond!

2. We're subclassing `commands.Context`. You’ll find this in `main.py`:
    - Import with `import main`, and use `main.Context`
    - This makes localization easier — check the docstring for details

3. The default language is **English**
    - New commands/features must include English-localized messages

4. Localization is handled via our custom package:  
   👉 [`discord-localization`](https://pypi.org/project/discord-localization)
    - Please check out our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/project-lumin) if you would like to add translations to the bot!

5. We use **NumPy-style docstrings**
    - All non-command functions should have docstrings, unless clearly self-explanatory (e.g., `load_cogs`)

6. **Helpers** are used for shared, reusable logic (e.g., `EconomyHelper` in `economy.py`)

7. For formatting, we use **custom argument classes** (e.g., `CustomUser`):
    - If you're adding a new argument class, please include a `from_X` classmethod (e.g., `CustomUser.from_user()`)
    - These help ensure editable messages are safe and intuitive (e.g., `CustomUser.avatar` returns the URL, not the raw asset)

8. Questions? DM **@pearoo** on Discord.

## Versioning & Releasing

Version numbers follow **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**:

- **MAJOR** → Breaking changes (e.g., full module overhauls)
    - Resets MINOR and PATCH to `0`
- **MINOR** → New features or updated command sets
    - Resets PATCH to `0`
- **PATCH** → Bugfixes, internal tweaks, or localization updates

> ⚠️ Version suffixes (e.g., `-beta`, `-dev`) will **not** be present in the live bot.
